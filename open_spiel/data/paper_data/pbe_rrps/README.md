The `bot_table_file.txt` is a data set described in
[Population-based Evaluation in Repeated RPS as a Benchmark for Multiagent RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03196)
and parsed by `python/examples/roshambo_population_example.py`. 

It contains a cross-table of the expected values for all possible match-ups
between the 43 RRPS bots, using an average of 1000 games per cell.
